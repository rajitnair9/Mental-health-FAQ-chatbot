I leveraged a powerful LSTM model and a question-answering dataset to develop a chatbot with remarkable accuracy during training.

I crafted both a Flask-based web chatbot, which securely saves users' chat history using SQLite, and a Telegram chatbot using the Python Telegram Bot library.

Beyond the topic of mental health, this project serves as an architecture for creating customized chatbots across diverse domains, contingent upon the availability of accurate data.

I overcame challenges arising from limited training data by implementing techniques like sequence padding and embedding layers. Creating this personal project was a fun experience despite the inherent limitations.

Future work may include integrating LLM models, which have become a prominent trend in the field
